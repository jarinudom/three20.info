=========================

If you're planning to make a new project using three20 then you can save some time by using
custom three20 project templates. They're easy to install.

First, you'll want to
[download the projects](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jverkoey/three20.info/three20Projects.zip).

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the package, open Terminal to the directory containing
the file "install_projects" and simply type

."brush: bash"
    bash install_projects

To create a new project using Three20, start Xcode and open the "New Project" dialog. You
should now see a "User Projects" directory with the three20 projects listed. The latest set of
project templates includes a project for creating a basic application and a project for creating a
basic application with a core data backend.
