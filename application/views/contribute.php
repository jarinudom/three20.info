=============

Three20 is a growing library of code. Here are a couple ways you can contribute to the project.

Via GitHub
----------

If you have a fork of three20 on GitHub, then you can make a pull request from the GitHub interface.

Here's [GitHub's pull request guide](http://github.com/guides/pull-requests).

Contribute to three20.info
--------------------------

We've taken a rather odd approach to managing the three20.info website; we've open-sourced it on
GitHub.

This means that you can fork the site, contribute your own articles, fixes, and
updates, and we'll merge it back into the live site. It's basically a wiki, but without the
complicated wiki backend.

All of the articles on the site are written with Markdown.
