=========================

Three20 is a growing library of code. Here are a couple ways you can contribute to the project.

Request a merge request
-----------------------

If you have a fork of three20 then you can ask for a pull request from the github interface.

Here's github's [guide for pull requests](http://github.com/guides/pull-requests).

Contribute to three20.info
--------------------------

We've taken a rather odd approach to managing the three20.info website; we've open-sourced it.

This means that you can fork the site, contribute your own articles, fixes, and
updates, and we'll merge it back into the live site. It's basically a wiki, but without the
complicated wiki backend.

All of the articles on the site are written with Markdown.

[Fork the site](http://github.com/jverkoey/three20.info) on github.
